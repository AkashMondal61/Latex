11	AI Based Criminal Detection and Tracking system for public safety and security	Jamuna S Murthy1, Siddesh2	Jamuna S Murthy1, Siddesh2	1 Ramaiah Institute of Technology | 2 MSRIT		jamunamurthy.s@gmail.com, siddeshgm14@gmail.com	The rise of criminal activities in public spaces has created a need for an efficient and reliable system that can detect, recognize, and track criminals. To address this need, an AI-based criminal detection, recognition, and tracking system has been proposed that can enhance public safety and security. The system automates the manual task of detecting and recognizing criminals, providing law enforcement agencies with a reliable and efficient tool to prevent and solve crimes. Proposed system leverages a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture called “CriminalNet-228 “to detect and recognize criminal faces in CCTV camera footage. CriminalNet-228 is trained on a large dataset of criminal images to increase the accuracy of the system. To improve the performance of face detection and acknowledge parallel processing and distributed computing is used additional computing resources. This allows the system to analyze vast amounts of CCTV footage simultaneously, which is not possible for humans to do in real-time. The system tracks the movements of recognized criminals using a map, providing law enforcement officials with real-time information to take appropriate action. The proposed CriminalNet-228 architecture has achieved an overall Mean Average Precision of of 0.65. The model is able to detect the faces of size as small as 4*4.

These emotional states experienced by students play a crucial role in shaping their engagement, motivation, and overall learning experience. Simultaneously, studies in learning analytics have showcased the potential of leveraging the abundant data gathered by e-learning systems such as ITS to identify patterns in student behavior for highlighting the indicators of student learning outcomes. In our current research investigation, we have examined four crucial affective states, namely Boredom, Frustration, Confusion, and Concentration, along with student interaction data collected from the Assistments platform. Our research has a dual purpose. The first objective is to gain insights into the influence of student affective states and scaffolding on learning progress within a blended learning environment. The second objective is to develop a transparent,data-driven framework based on machine learning that improves educational outcomes. We utilized clickstream and knowledge component data to employ four machine learning models, specifically RandomForest, Linear Regression and neural network, for the prediction of student performance. We compared these models bothin the traditional approach and our proposed framework, MLF-DSM.. Furthermore,we employed XAI techniques, specifically SHAP to enhance the transparency of the results obtained from this black box model. Overall, our study highlights the applicability of MLF-DSM as a dynamic assessment and personalization tool within a blended learning environment.

There are a few techniques proposed by different researchers like lane departure warning: This technique uses a camera to detect lane markings on the road and warns the driver if the vehicle drifts out of the lane without signalling. This can help prevent accidents caused by distracted or drowsy driving. Forward collision warning: This technique uses sensors to detect the distance between the vehicle and objects in front of it, and informs the driver if the vehicle is approaching an item or another vehicle too closely. By doing this, rear-end accidents may be avoided. In this study, we suggested a system that analyses a driver's facial expression to conclude whether or not the driver is drowsy. This image-based system monitors the driver's alertness and detects sleepiness by employing convolutional neural networks for computer vision and machine learning. To determine whether a person is feeling sleepy, this technology analyses facial characteristics.

Here, edge servers are deployed in close proximity to mobile devices to promote low latency and improve the present network architecture. Computation and storage are transferred from the core network to the edge network for faster and more reliable service. However, the primary challenge in the deployment of mobile edge computing architecture is the optimal placement of the edge servers since finding an appropriate location for the edge servers is fundamental and critical. In this paper, we have formulated the edge server placement problem as a constraint optimization problem that places edge servers strategically to balance their workloads and reduce access delay between the base stations and edge servers. A modified GSO algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution that minimizes the number of edge server requirements. The proposed approach is simulated in MATLAB. The results demonstrate the behavior of the proposed approach subject to varying densities of base stations with respect to clusters. The proposed algorithm is also found to perform better in comparison to state-of-the-art Edge Server Placement algorithms.

In this study, an effort has been made to predict this silent killer disease using machine learning approach. Benchmark datasets were collected from various countries (Iraq, USA etc.) and five decision tree algorithms - ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3), C4.5, CART, CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector), MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) were applied on the datasets. Decision trees are popular ML technique for easy implementation and interpretability. This study analyzed each distinct approach followed by each decision tree classifier with their merits, demerits and occasion of application. Several performance parameters (accuracy, precision, recall etc.) were evaluated and their efficacy in different circumstances is analyzed in detail. Even though, CART, C4.5 and ID3 are popular techniques, MARS and CHAID are less investigated. On the other hand, as accuracy is wide spread, the significance of recall and precision are many times overlooked. This study addresses these limitations with valuable facts and findings.

This is mainly achieved by concealing multiple signatures dynamically in circular orientations governed by hash operations performed on shared secret key and session random challenge. Further, with the use of particular bit sequencing patterns dynamically decided through similar hash operations and also region wise segmented casting of such signatures uplifts their security and resilience significantly. Moreover, dynamic threshold reference range based region wise variable encoding of these signatures clearly improves signature protection and recovery under various attacks. Additionally, this work also uses self-defined algebraic block transforms to embed the signature data and thereby enhancing the robustness greatly. Since receiver knows all the secret data, so by adopting exactly same hash functions and reverse mathematical operations of bit coding in proper order those casted signatures can be authenticated trustfully. Finally, exhaustive testing have fully established efficacy of this approach in contrast to the current works from various angles while it also confirms much superior authentication and confidentiality.

This paper proposes an optimization-based approach for solar power distribution in microgrids, considering both predicted solar energy and actual solar generation. The objective is to optimally distribute solar power among homes in a microgrid while ensuring minimal energy waste. The optimization model is formulated to minimize the squared difference between the distributed power and the demand of each home, subject to constraints on the total distributed power and individual home demands. The distribution technique considers the proportionate share of actual solar generation based on the predicted solar energy distribution. The impact of the accuracy of the solar power forecasting model on energy waste reduction is investigated through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that the energy waste decreases once the accuracy of the forecasting model increases, highlighting the importance of accurate predictions in achieving efficient solar power distribution.

The Nearest Neighbour (NN) condition, which requires the operational qubits associated with the quantum gates to be next to one another, is one such design limitation that has been encountered despite the significant breakthroughs in the practical realization of quantum circuits. In this paper, we have illustrated a heuristic based design methodology to effectively convert quantum circuits into nearest neighbor-compliant architectures. Our proposed approach involves fitting the algorithm into a 2D design. We extensively tested our algorithm across a diverse range of benchmarks, and comparisons with leading design approaches revealed significant enhancements. Our overall technique is built on our initial qubit placing strategy, due to which we proposed an effective traversing and mapping system that is carried out with the help of modified prim’s algorithm and genetic algorithm, respectively. This combination of heuristic strategies has shown promising outcomes in transforming quantum circuits into NN compliant architectures. In conclusion, we thoroughly evaluated a wide array of benchmarks using our conversion techniques and conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis, including state-of-the-art designs and various placement methods. We compared the efficacy of our proposed approach with previous research efforts.

Consequently, this study focuses on developing a future traffic flow forecasting system. To accomplish this, we used a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and a large dataset of time series data to construct the GPA model, which aims to predict future traffic flow. The GPA model effectively captures the long-term patterns within the sequential big dataset and incorporates traffic flow characteristics from various junctions. The general public needs an accurate and timely predictor of future traffic flow to help mitigate air pollution. To address this demand, this study employs time series analysis and explores the spatial and temporal correlations within traffic data for traffic prediction. The evaluation results demonstrate the performance of the GPA model, indicating that it outperforms the ARIMA and SARIMA models by achieving a 40% and 50% improvement in future traffic flow prediction, respectively, through network loss minimization. The network loss is measured using the root-mean-squared error, while model performance is assessed using the mean absolute error and mean squared error metrics.

Currently social media platforms are generating hundreds of petabytes of data on the internet which can be used by the academic researchers and the IT marketing team to extract useful information from it. Sarcasm and Fake News Detection is one such trending area of research that discusses about fake internet articles on the web which has lead to mass confusion amongst the general uninformed public. Existing literatures that are profound in the field of sarcasm and fake news detection mainly focused on two classes i.e. fake or real with machine learning algorithms which can be a limitation when it comes to the news that can be nearly true and classified as fake. Hence the proposed work introduces a real-time framework for sarcasm detection using novel deep learning approach called Tensor-DNN for multiclass.  TDNN Model aims at classifying news article as per its authenticity and also returns the extent of sarcasm within the article. The Algorithm is compared against top state of art techniques such as SVM, att-RNN and EANN among which proposed algorithm provides the best accuracy of 96.4% for two class, 94.32% for four class and 99.1% for seven class accuracies. 
54	Hypermotifs in biological networks: TGFβ induced EMT as a case study	Sai Bhavani Gottumukkala 1, Anbumathi Palanisamy 2	Sai Bhavani Gottumukkala 1, Anbumathi Palanisamy 2	1 National Institute of Technology Warangal | 2 National Institute of Technology Warangal		gsaib@student.nitw.ac.in, anbu@nitw.ac.in	Complex systems describe a collection of entities and interactions influencing each other and are prevalent in various domains. Networks are one of the common ways to represent these complex systems across various disciplines. In biology, networks provide a mathematical constriction to interpret the association between biological molecules. Network motifs are the small subgraph patterns within the large biological networks which play several crucial functional roles. While network motifs like coherent feedforward loops are extensively analyzed, there are limited studies on how these network motifs are combined to form hypermotifs within the biological networks, and what properties may emerge from these hypermotifs are not extensively studied. Recent studies highlighted the prevailing role of hypermotifs in various contexts (Adler & Medzhitov, 2022; Sai Bhavani & Palanisamy, 2023). This work presents some of the hypermotis observed in regulating Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis. Further, the systems level modeling results of these hypermotifs towards illustrating their emergent behavior using the discreet and continuous dynamic modeling approaches were presented. Understanding the emergent properties of hypermotifs contributes to our broader comprehension of network-based regulation in complex biological systems such as,  cancer metastasis.

One of the significant advantages of treatment with vitamin-related derivatives is the lack of side effects. It has been observed in recent studies that vitamins have shown immense potential treatment to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. However, studies regarding the mechanisms to inhibit the growth of cancer cells are still far from reality. Several gene expressions are involved in T-cell lymphomas' growth, including Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, and notch1, which assist by signaling. These signaling pathways are often responsible for the growth of T-cell lymphoma. In this study, molecular docking was performed to investigate the interaction of different vitamins with these signaling gene expressions/ proteins. Vitamin A shows the highest binding affinity as compared to other vitamins. On the other hand, β-catenin shows the highest binding affinity compared to other proteins with the vitamins. Whether this binding will lead to upregulation or downregulation of the gene expressions is yet to be studied, and further experimentation is required, such as RT-qPCR. However, the significant binding affinity can help in the identification of drugs that can interact with the gene expression and assist in its downregulation, which will initiate the inhibition of lymphoma cell growth.

Patel 2	1 NIT,SURAT | 2 NIT Surat		d20co005@coed.svnit.ac.in, sjp@coed.svnit.ac.in	Music plays a significant role in various aspects of human life. With the progress of technology, music has evolved, and artificial intelligence has become a valuable tool for newcomers in the creative process. However, manually or automatically generating music is a complex task due to the many variables involved. Different approaches leverage deep learning to generate music using different types of musical data, such as raw waveforms or structured formats like MIDI or MusicXML. In this research, sequence-based models like LSTM are employed for this purpose, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing sequence information. The goal is to artificially create human-sounding music, adhering to established rules and classic rhythms while fostering originality. This paper introduces an LSTM network for music generation, providing an accessible overview of the underlying theory and its application in modeling music sequences. Additionally, an analysis is conducted to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed model. The qualitative impact of the model output is assessed, and potential areas for improvement are discussed, guiding future work in this field.
58	Few shot learning with fine-tuned language model for suicidal text detection	Shivam Shivam 1, Biswarup Ray 2	Shivam Shivam 1, Biswarup Ray 2	1 ZS Associates | 2 ZS		shivam.shivam@zs.com, raybiswarup9@gmail.com	The most effective way to prevent potential suicide attempts is early identification followed by prompt treatment. Nowadays, online communication channels especially social media is becoming a way of expressing suicidal tendencies. However, the availability of properly tagged textual data is a major issue for researchers to perform identification or classification of such tendencies through texts. In light of the abovementioned facts, in the present work, we have proposed an approach to determine early detection with the goal of early diagnosis of suicidal behaviour through text posted on social media via supervised learning using few shot learning process. Therefore, to detect suicidal behaviour, we extract embeddings by finetuning a large pretrained language model. The contextual embeddings have then been used for binary classification of the text for suicidal behaviour, in which a comparison of various classifiers has been performed. This includes traditional supervised classifiers and neural network models. A comparison of the model’s performance with and without an outlier detection and removal step has also been performed to highlight the importance of the outlier detection step in the pipeline.

In this paper, we propose an automated face recognition system. The concept of ‘INTERNET OF THINGS’ is used for face detection which can detect human faces using the Haar cascade classifier. An inbuilt camera is continuously detecting the face frame by frame and the PCA algorithm is used for feature selection. A forward-looking view of face recognition is presented. The experiment results show that the proposed model is very accurate, reliable, and can be practically implemented in a real-life environment as an automatic recognition system.

However, the limited computational capability of the smart hand- helds hampers the inherent need for real-time responsiveness of the ap- plication. Thus, dimensionality reduction through Feature Selection (FS) techniques could be a precursor for on-device learning and prediction of activities. Most of the existing FS approaches focus on the algorithmic perspectives and ignore the data-intensive nature of the application. So, in this paper, we perform a comparative study of the FS techniques uti- lized for HAR subject to the role of feature preprocessing. Apart from de- tailing the FS methods, the work also shows how to apply those methods in combination. The experimental results across the benchmark datasets show the efficiency of our application strategies of the FS techniques.

Various biological processes, such as signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolism, heavily depend on these interactions. In addition, they are also important targets for drug discovery. Network analysis, a computational approach that characterises the topological properties of PPI networks, has become a powerful tool for comprehending the organisation and function of these networks. These techniques can be applied to PPI networks to gain insights into the functional modules, key proteins, and biological pathways that are involved in these processes.  In this paper, two sets of PPI networks - one representing normal cells and the other representing tumour cells - were firstly analysed using the NetworkX library in Python, followed by their visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries of Python and Gephi. The networks were constructed from publicly available protein interaction data and network analysis techniques were subsequently used to compare their properties. Additionally, the results may provide insights into the underlying biological processes. To sum up, the analysis in this paper demonstrates the utility of network analysis in understanding the differences between normal and tumour cells at the protein interaction level.

To design a reliable automated KYC system with multiple verifiers is difficult, since a single identity theft or data breach may lead to serious frauds. Permissioned blockchain has been evolved as a significant solution to handle sensitive data, which is one of the state-of-art meth- ods for performing KYC. This paper presents a novel smart-contract based system, which utilizes a permissioned blockchain with deep learning enhanced user data acquisition for onboarding consumer. In place of manual data collection, an automated deep learning based data extraction module extracts the data from the uploaded documents which is further utilized by smart contract logic for validation. The proposed framework guarantees that a user, once registered into system, need not repeat the KYC, unless any update is initiated which helps in avoiding repetition of KYC.

The evaluation of fractal dimension values reveals distinct mangrove communities in different regions of interest (ROI). The proposed Gate-based fractal dimension evaluation approach is utilized, incorporating techniques like Exponential Dilation and Shadow removal for better edge identification and image noise reduction. Evaluating Fractal dimensions and Hurst exponent values provides insights into spatial heterogeneity, diversity, and long-term persistence of mangrove habitats. The modified gate-based fractal analysis method is employed, offering improved stability compared to box-counting methods. Landsat 8 satellite data from 2019 to 2023 is used for analysis. ROI2 exhibits the highest average fractal dimension value of 1.949, indicating a diverse and heterogeneous habitat. The Hurst exponent values support the presence of different mangrove communities in ROI1 and ROI2, as well as ROI2 and ROI3, highlighting unique communities within each region.The findings enhance knowledge of spatial patterns, diversity, and stability in mangrove ecosystems.

In most cases we use simple techniques like addition or column averaging for loss computation. But this allows gradients to be distributed equally among all paths. The proposed approach attempts to guide the gradients of backpropagation along weakest branches of the neural network. A weakness score is proposed that defines the class specific performance of individual logits. This is then used to create a new output distribution that would guide gradients along the weakest pathways. The proposed approach has been shown to perform better than traditional column merging techniques and can be used in several application scenarios. Not only can the proposed model be used as an efficient technique for training multiple instances of a model parallelly, but also CNNs with multiple output branches have been shown to perform better with the proposed upgrade. Various experiments establish the flexibility of the learning technique which is simple yet effective in various multi-objective scenarios both empirically and statistically.

In many practical applications, linear or cubic interpolation technique is used, but it produces unsatisfactory results in edge and corner regions due to blurring and jagging artifacts. Several methods have been proposed to improve the performance of the interpolation technique, among them somewhere edge guided noniterative technique, curvature-based iterative method, and statistical learning-based method is used. Although it slightly improves the performance of traditional interpolation techniques, it can’t avoid blurring artifacts. Moreover, some of the methods are high in computational complexity. In this method, we have proposed a new interpolation technique inspired by the property of gravitational force.  From this property, we have determined whether the region According to the region, 8-neighbors are interpolated with the weighted value of one or more neighbor pixels. Our method is very fast regarding computational complexity and shows its superiority in a well-known interpolation method in respect of subjective and objective quality.

The technique uses machine learning algorithms to classify comments as illegal or not. It builds on pre-annotated commentary material by analyzing various features such as specific words and phrases and using context analysis. Algorithms identify patterns and correlations between text and toxicity, and a model is trained to recognize these patterns. Using specific words and phrases helps algorithms identify commonly used toxic words such as profanity, hate speech and bullying. Sentiment analysis is critical in identifying comments that may not contain toxic words but are still harmful to the community. Contextual analysis helps determine whether a comment is relevant or extraneous to the discussion and is also an important factor in identifying malicious comments. Implementation of this technique can have a significant impact on moderating and maintaining online platforms and communities, curbing toxic language, promoting a positive and respectful environment, and increasing inclusion and participation. This technique offers a solution to the growing problem of toxic comments by making online platforms safer and more enjoyable for everyone.

The main purpose is to capture the low-level and high-level image characteristics to enhance the representation of visual patterns. Initially, we apply a CNN to the RGB color image, which extracts high-level features and creates a feature descriptor known as FVCNN with a dimension of 128. We further divide the RGB image into its red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components to complement the CNN-based features. Then, to find patterns within each component, we use sparse local ternary pattern (LTP) operators in diagonal and (vertical, horizontal) directions. The LTP-based features are then combined to create an additional feature descriptor known as the ternary feature descriptor (FVT), which is then used to create histograms. If the FVT has a high dimensionality, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce it to only the top 128 features. The final feature descriptor (FVFinal), with a dimension of 256, is created by combining the feature descriptors FVCNN and FVT. In order to capture a wider range of visual characteristics, this feature fusion aims to take advantage of the complementary strengths of both CNN-based and handcrafted features. To choose the most effective metric for the retrieval process, this paper evaluates seven similarity metrics include Bray-Curtis, Canberra, Chebyshev, City block, Correlation, Cosine, Euclidean. The proposed method is validated by trials on the UCM dataset, which produced satisfactory retrieval outcomes.
83	Deep Fusion-Net: A U-Net and CGAN-Based Approach for Salient Object Detection	Gayathri Dhara 1	Gayathri Dhara 1	1 SRM University-AP		gayathridhara@srmap.edu.in	Saliency detection, a critical task in the field of vision computing, with a goal to identify the visual prominent regions within an input image. The method of automated saliency identification has caught the interest of various application fields during the last decade.  A novel method is proposed for saliency detection through Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with a pre-trained UNet model as the generator. The generated saliency maps are evaluated by the discriminator for authenticity and gives feedback to enhance the generator’s ability to generate high-resolution saliency maps. By iteratively training the discriminator and generator networks, the model achieves improved performance in salient object detection. By combining the strengths of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and the UNet architecture, our goal is to improve the accuracy and enhance the quality. Once the U-Net model is trained and its weights are saved, we then integrated it into the CGAN framework for salient object detection. The U-Net will serve as the generator component of the CGAN, responsible for generating saliency maps for input images. The components of CGAN, are trained using adversarial learning to enhance the quality and realism of the generated saliency maps. Precision, recall, MAE and Fβ score measurements are used to evaluate performance. Thorough experiments have conducted on three challenging saliency detection datasets, our model has demonstrated remarkable performance surpassing the latest models for saliency. Further, faster convergence is observed in our model due to the initialization of the CGAN’s generator using pre-trained U-Net model weights.
86	Deep Learning Based Ensemble Model for Detection of Myocardial Infarction from ECG data	Dipanwita Saha1	Dipanwita Saha1	1 Academy of Technology		dipanwitasaha.cse@gmail.com	The myocardial infarction(MI) is the deadly state of heart attack bearing probable risk of death. The early detection of such state can easily save the human life. The ECG or electrocardiogram can be the good mean of detection of myocardial infarc-tion of any cardiac patient. The interpretation of ECG waveform can be done by the deep learning based Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model. In the present study, the accuracy of such work has been enhanced by appointing ensemble model consisting of the CNN with Random forest (RF). The extraction of features from the ECG has been taken place at CNN layer followed by myocardial detection at the  RF layer. The PCA has been used to estimate feature reduction followed by encoding of labeled multi modal data. Signal of ECG data are measured through visibly fluctuation of HRV compared to the adjacent beats. The hyper parameters have been evaluated before processing of the whole data in CNN resulting into considerable performance gain. The result obtained has got better score over the other conventional classifiers like ANN and SVM with the estimated accuracy value of 97%.  Rhythm measurement has also been done through SDNN, RMSSD and prediction of results were evaluated through the metrics of Precision, Recall, accuracy, ROC curve in order to detect risk factors in early phase of time with the consequences of reduction in  the death rate. 
87	Unsupervised MTS Anomaly Detection with Variational AutoEncoders	Saravana  M K 1, Roopa M S 2	Saravana  M K 1, Roopa M S 2	1 University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering 		mksaravanamk1@gmail.com, roopams22@gmail.com	MTS data often involves multiple variables or measurements recorded at each time point which poses several challenges, such as High-Dimensionality, which increases the complexity of analyzing and detecting anomalies, as the interactions between variables need to be considered. Handling high-dimensional data requires careful feature selection, dimensionality reduction techniques, or models specifically designed to handle such data. In addition, MTS data exhibits temporal dependencies, i.e, observations at different time points are correlated. However, the strength and nature of these dependencies can vary, making it challenging accurately to model and capture the underlying patterns. Detecting anomalies requires understanding the temporal dynamics and distinguishing between normal variations and unusual behaviors. Most importantly, in many real-world scenarios, labeled anomalies are scarce or non-existent. Anomaly detection methods often rely on labeled data for training and evaluation, but without sufficient labeled anomalies, it becomes difficult to develop effective models. Unsupervised or semi-supervised techniques are often employed in such cases, but their performance is limited compared to supervised methods. Addressing these challenges requires domain knowledge, appropriate feature engineering, careful algorithm selection, and model evaluation. Additionally, iterative refinement and adaptation of anomaly detection methods based on feedback and domain-specific insights are often necessary for achieving optimal results. In this paper we present Unsupervised Anomaly Detection model for MTS data based on Variational Autoencoder called as VAE-MTS which outperforms traditional Autoencoders and GAN-based Anomaly detection methods.

Deep learning methods that perform well are significantly data-driven. As more data is trained, the deep learning model’s performance becomes much more robust and generalizable. On the other hand, collecting medical data in a central storage system to train effective deep learning models raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and regulatory compliance. Federated learning overcomes the previous difficulties by using a deep learning model which is shared and a centralized aggregating platform. On the other side, patient data resides with the local party, assuring data confidentiality and data security. First, we give a comprehensive, up-to-date survey of federated learning research in healthcare applications. Next, we propose a solution for preparation of the medical dataset for federated learning approach from publicly available medical repositories and then apply federated averaging(FedAvg) and FedProx algorithm for aggregating across clients without accessing local private data.
94	Modeling the Role of Gap Junctions in An Olfactory Neuropil, The Antennal Lobe 	Dileep G 1	Dileep G 1	1 IIT Mandi		dileepmon2@gmail.com	The sense of smell is vital for many animals, particularly insects, who rely on it to detect and differentiate various odours, which is critical for their survival and ability to reproduce. In insects, the antennal lobe (AL) is the main processing centre for olfactory signals, containing a complex network of neurons that analyze and integrate olfactory information.  Gap junctions are a vital element of the AL neural network and have been demonstrated to be significant in processing and transmitting olfactory information. However, their precise function within the AL system is not yet comprehensively understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study aims to use both experimental and computational methods to model the role of gap junctions within the AL circuitry. The primary focus is to create a computational model of the gap junctions that exist between local neurons and projection neurons within the AL. A biologically accurate model has been employed to mimic the behaviour of the AL neural network, with the goal of exploring the impact of gap junctions on the processing and transmission of olfactory information. The findings of our study demonstrate the crucial role that gap junctions play in synchronizing the activity of neurons within the AL circuitry. Our computational model provides a framework for comprehending the function of gap junctions within the AL network, and it could be utilized to evaluate the impact of these junctions on olfactory processing in other insects. In summary, our results contribute to a greater understanding of the functional organization of the olfactory system and may have implications for the development of insect control strategies. 
97	Identification of Human Drug Targets for COVID-19 Based on Subcellular Localization Information, Gene Expression Data and Node2vec	Chandrima Das 1, Sovan Saha 2	Chandrima Das 1, Sovan Saha 2	1 Institute of Engineering and Management | 2 Techno Main Salt Lake		chandrimapfl@gmail.com, sovansaha12@gmail.com	For the last few years, humans have been searching for a good solution to the lethal disease of COVID-19. Finding human proteins that can be drugged to fight diseases like this is vital. Identification of essential proteins is an integral part of human drug design. Wet lab studies like single gene knockouts, RNA interference, and anti-sense RNA are employed to discover essential proteins. Despite being exceedingly accurate, these methods are costly and time-consuming. So, this led to an increase in the demand for computational methods. The two main categories for computational methods are topology-based methods and sequence-based methods. While sequence-based methods predict essential proteins using the sequence features of proteins, the former uses the topological aspects of protein-protein Interaction Networks. Simply using topological features to predict essential proteins produces less accurate predictions. Hence, this research proposes a machine learning-based methodology for identifying COVID-19 drug targets by integrating several biological information. RNA-Sequence and subcellular location data are used as the features. This forms the weighted PPI network using Pearson Correlation coefficient after performing Principal Component Analysis. The topological features for the proteins are obtained from the feature vector set using node2vec. Lastly, the best features are selected, which will be used as input for the ML models. Machine learning models like Naïve Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Classification and XGBBoost Classifier are trained on the data. The best-performing models are then used to identify novel COVID-19 drug targets.

The basic layout of it is having components like the substrate (Si), SiO 2 , metal for through Si via (TSV) and so on. These different types of used materials in a 3DIC develop a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Simultaneously, during the circuit operation, there is simultaneous generation of heat in the substrate and in the surroundings of the 3DIC. Both the mismatch in CTE and generation of heat results in an expansion of the materials thereby inducing local stress. In this paper, we have analyzed the impact of TSV-aided stress on MOSFET characteristics generated by the stacked 3D structure. The variation of stress characteristics of a stacked 3DIC structure was studied by considering a simple device simulation method.

In this paper, we explore and compare three phase shift methods for phase optimization: 1. maximum energy path (MEP), 2. mean phase shift (MPS), and 3. weighted phase shift (WPS). Our results consistently show that the WPS method outperforms the others in terms of bit error rate (BER) across various system setups, including multiple-input multiple output (MIMO). Additionally, we consider the impact of the number of reflecting elements, modulation order, detector, and the number of antennas in the system analysis. Furthermore, we analyze the time complexity for different system setups. These findings provide valuable insights into optimal phase configurations with low complexity, contributing to the understanding and improvement of wireless communication performance in diverse scenarios

In this context, a new IoT trend known as Social IoT (SIoT) was examined for this study.  The Social IoT has the advantage of connectivity demonstrated within the network of connected  things via the IoT. In Social IoT, a wide range of IoT devices, such as wearables or monitoring  sensors, are utilized in E-Healthcare applications and the risk of identity theft and impersonation  is a significant concern. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that incorporates multi-factor authentication, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and hash functions scheme to provide  a robust solution for secure and privacy-preserving authentication. Our system provides privacy  protection along with mutual authentication and session key negotiation at a considerably low  computational cost (of up to 71.04% compared to other existing techniques).

Institute of Technology		divyasdivu1994@gmail.com, shmanjula@gmail.com, venugopalkr@gmail.com	The rapid integration of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) into our everyday lives necessitates robust security measures. Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate resource congestion in SIoT environments. However, ensuring the security of edge networks remains a critical challenge due to various types of attacks and unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of intrusion detection models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), for CEC-based SIoT. Our study encompasses three major components: feature extraction, model design, and evaluation. We evaluate the performance of each model using the CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 and CIC-DDoS 2019 datasets, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results demonstrate that our CNN-based intrusion detection model achieves better accuracy compared to GAN and LR. Additionally, we outline future research directions, including the integration of CNN and GAN for spatiotemporal feature extraction and the development of real-time feature extraction algorithms. By shedding light on the effectiveness of different intrusion detection models, our work contributes to enhancing the security of SIoT in CEC environments, leading to safer and more reliable IoT deployments.

It aims to address the issues of latency, bandwidth constraints, and network reliability in the context of IoT. However, fog computing paradigm faces issues in adopting to the dynamic workloads, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient performance due to the dynamicity in the requests raised by the IoT devices and the edge applications. This work proposes a anomaly detection based resource autoscaling mechanism based on the deep autoencoders. Deep autoencoders uses neural networks to detect the anomalies in the data, based on which the virtual machines in the fog node are auto scaled. Anomaly scores and response times for the three variants of deep autoencoders are compared. The outcome indicates that the proposed approach improves the scalability, responsiveness and resource utilization.
110	On Coverage and Connectivity with Reduced Sensing Redundancy based on Genetic Algorithm	Rajib  Kumar Mondal 1, Sanghita Bhattacharjee 2, Tandra Pal 3	Rajib  Kumar Mondal 1, Sanghita Bhattacharjee 2, Tandra Pal 3	1 Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College | 2 National Institute of Technology, Durgapur | 3 NIT Durgapur		rajib94@gmail.com, sanghita.bhattacharjee@cse.nitdgp.ac.in, tandra.pal@cse.nitdgp.ac.in	In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), coverage and connectivity are crucial factors for effectively monitoring targets and transmitting data to the base station. To increase the network's robustness, targets must be covered by multiple sensors. In k-coverage, each target is monitored by a minimum of k distinct sensors. Many studies focus on achieving k -coverage but they overlook the issue of sensing redundancy. Sensing redundancy occurs when targets are covered by more than k sensors. However, minimizing redundant sensing may lead to coverage holes in the network. To address this problem, our study proposes a genetic algorithm that considers four conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of sensors, maximizing k -coverage, maximizing m -connectivity, and minimizing sensing redundancy. The fitness function is designed to balance these objectives. By reducing the number of targets that generates sensing redundancy, our proposed method aims to minimize redundant sensing and network energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm, which outperforms two existing works in the literature
128	Trust Management Model for Service Delegation in SIoT	Santhosh Kumari1	Santhosh Kumari1	1 UVCE, Bangalore		santhoshkumariy@gmail.com	The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an extension of Internet of Things that blends social networking ideas and concepts into the domain of social networking, device connectivity and communication. During exchange of information and services with their peers, trust plays an important role in establishing relationship with trustworthy peers and reduces the risk of being exposed to malicious nodes. The existing approaches lack adequate trust quantification and are further hindered by biased evaluations of trustworthiness, as they fail to consider the diverse behavior of a node when delivering different services. In this paper, a trust Management model is introduced to calculate trust between communicating nodes in relation to a particular service. Additionally, an algorithm is proposed to recommend a more reliable service provider for service delegation, aiming to reduce the vulnerability to malicious nodes. The trust management model incorporates various factors, including direct trust, recommended trust, co-operativeness, computation capability, and relationship factors, to capture the behavior of a node. These attributes are aggregated using the MLP-R algorithm to generate a consolidated trust score for each node. The proposed trust model is dependable and effective in boosting the success rate of services, while simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and security of services within the realm of SIoT.

There are two different kinds of WSNs: mobile WSN and static WSN. Distribution, location, and tracking are three of the many new conceptual and optimization challenges presented by WSNs. These challenges are particularly important given, the fact that a great number of applications are dependent on WSNs for information. There are a number of challenges associated with this type of WSN, including high bandwidth requirements, high energy consumption, the providing of Quality of Service (QoS), data processing, compression, and cross-layer design. Authors of this review have conducted a survey of the relevant literature and draw the conclusion that routing protocols for WSNs make use of a variety of approaches, such as Hierarchical Based Routing Protocols (HBRP) and Location-Based Routing Protocols (LBRP), in order to accomplish their goals. Each of these approaches is capable of meeting the necessary trans-mission specifications. The fundamental goal of the analysis is to ensure that both power consumption and security are taken into account while conducting the analysis of performance matrices.
141	SHAPRFs: SHapely Additive eXplanations based Random Forests algorithm for classification problems	Nishant Jain 1, Shipra Shukla 2	Nishant Jain 1, Shipra Shukla 2	1 Manipal University Jaipur | 2 Manipal University Jaipur		nishant.jain@jaipur.manipal.edu, shipra.shukla@jaipur.manipal.edu	“Tree-based ensemble algorithms” (TEAs) are widely used for classification and regression problems. However, existing TEAs lag behind the trade-off between TEA interpretability and achieving cutting-edge accuracy when applied to real-time applications. This paper proposes a new TEA for bridging the gap between real-time applications and the trade-off between TEA interpretability and cutting-edge accuracy. The proposed algorithm is based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value, which is one of the most advanced co-operative game solutions for quantifying each feature’s contribution to model prediction. As a result, we call our proposed algorithm the Shapely additive explanations based Random Forests algorithm (SHAPRFs). The proposed SHAPRFs compute the dominion of feature alliances using the SHAP value to determine the significance of each feature in the data set. Following suit, the SHAPRFs divide the features into two subsets based on the importance of each feature. Then it employs the Roulette wheel selection algorithm to generate decision trees (DTs) in the forest. Five benchmark data sets are used to test the SHAPRFs algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed SHAPRFs outperform three well-known and benchmark classifiers by a significant margin, namely, Breiman random forest (BRF), deep forest, and support vector machines (SVM).

Categorization of sport actions, representing difficult and complex body postures, is regarded as a fine-grained visual classification problem. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attained enhanced performance over conventional feature descriptors in recognizing various sport activities. In general, though decent improvement has been gained using deep learning for sport action recognition, however, recognition of women’s sport activities is not widely explored. Even, no benchmark dataset depicting women’s sport action with sufficient variations is available yet for study. Hence, fine-grained image classification of diverse sport categories involving female/women athletics requires immediate research attention. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an image dataset comprising world-wide popular 50 sport categories of women players only. A simple deep learning model is proposed that extracts the high-level deep features using a backbone CNN. Then, these features are pooled from a collection of regular regions representing local discriminative information. The spatial pyramid pooling is applied for mining semantic information and enhancing feature aggregation for classification. The proposed method has achieved satisfactory performance on the Women Sports dataset using four standard backbone CNNs. Moreover, our method has achieved better accuracy on the Yoga-82 pose recognition dataset with a significant margin e.g., 11.6% gain using ResNet-50 base CNN.
146	An approach on Stage Classification of Lung Cancer using Fuzzy Inference System	Debosmita Roy1	Debosmita Roy1	1 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology		debosmitaroy2016@gmail.com	Lung cancer stands as the second most prevalent global fatality attributed to cancer. Prior diagno-sis and timely identification are utmost important for effective treatment and to enhance survival outcomes. In recent years, machine learning techniques have exhibited immense potential in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer. This model proposes an approach for lung cancer stage classification using a fuzzy interface system (FIS). The proposed system integrates different techniques, including image processing, feature selection, and FIS, to achieve the classification of lung cancer stages.

The proposed system for ma-lignant and benign data achieved mean accuracy of 91.03%, demonstrating its potential as an effective tool for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. The proposed approach had a mean accura-cy of 93.89% and 93.51% for stage T1 and stage T2 malignant data respectively. Overall, this proposed model adds a significant improvement to the field of lung cancer diagnosis, treatment and has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

We show that unlike the multi-head one-way reversible finite automata model (where we are still not sure whether it accepts all the regular languages) parallel communicating one-way reversible finite automata systems can accept all the regular languages. Moreover, for every multi-head one-way reversible finite automaton, there exists a parallel communicating one-way reversible finite automata system which accepts the same language. We also make an interesting observation that although the components of the system are reversible the system as a whole is not reversible. On the basis of this, we conjecture that parallel communicating one-way reversible finite automata systems may accept languages not accepted by multi-head one-way reversible finite automata.
150	Identification And Detection of Rice Plant Diseases By Using Neural Network	RATNESH KUMAR DUBEY1	RATNESH KUMAR DUBEY1	1 IIIT Bhagalpur		ratneshnitr@gmail.com	The most serious disease that can affect paddy plants is blast disease. All over the world, it results in enormous yield losses. A fungus that attacks the plant's leaves, nodes, and grains is the main culprit behind the disease. Fungicides are frequently used to stop blast disease, but this approach has some drawbacks, including environmental pollution and the development of fungicide-resistant disease strains. An effective tool for modeling and managing complex systems, such as the blast disease in paddy plants, is fuzzy logic. In this study, we investigate the modeling and management of blast disease in paddy plants using fuzzy logic. We'll discuss the input variables, fuzzy sets, rule base, and output variables, among other components, that make up the fuzzy logic system. The various phases of fuzzy logic, including fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification, will also be covered. The advantages of using fuzzy logic to manage blast disease in paddy plants, including its capacity to deal with ambiguous and imprecise data and its potential to integrate with other control systems, will be discussed in the final section.The fungal disease known as rice leaf blast, which is having a devastating effect on rice production and quality throughout the globe, thrives in warm, humid environments. Management of rice production relies on precise and non-destructive diagnostic techniques. The use of hyperspectral imaging technologies for diagnosing plant diseases has much promise. The problem with using hyperspectral data to build an effective illness classification model is that it contains a lot of duplicated information. However, a lack of representative features has been gathered due to the complexity and limited scope of agricultural hyperspectral imaging data collection.This paper discussed the four models DenseNet169-MLP,CNN, EfficientNetB3,and DNN JOA. DenseNet169-MLP achieve the highest accuracy   96.52, precision of 100, F1-score 94.29 compare to other model.
151	Quantum Resistant Hash-Based Digital Signature Schemes: A Review	Swarna Panthi1	Swarna Panthi1	1 North eastern hill university		swarnapanthi1997@gmail.com	Our trust in traditional digital signature schemes has been shaken by the current development towards quantum computers. Digital signatures are currently based on public key cryptosystems like El- Gamal, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Rivest, Shamir, Adleman algorithm (RSA), etc. The security of these public key cryptosystems is based on the assumptions of the computational infeasibility of a few known mathematical problems and several quantum algorithms such as Shor etc. exist for solving these mathematical problems. Therefore a lot of research is ongoing on the development of new signature schemes called Post-quantum digital signatures that can be used on both classical and quantum computers. The major families of postquantum signatures are multivariate, isogeny-based, lattice-based, noncommutative, code-based, and hash-based. This paper focuses on hash-based signature schemes. Hash-based signature schemes’ security has been firmly established against both classical and quantum attacks, making them a secure, efficient, and prominent candidate for post-quantum digital signature schemes. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of various hash-based signature schemes and contrast them under different criteria. This paper also presents the implementation results of the schemes to understand the working and correlations among different parameters which will help future researchers to develop signature schemes for different environments.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have emerged to predict suicidal behavior using various behavioral traits. But to date, the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predicting suicidal behavior in the Indian context has not been explored in literature. In this study, different machine learning algorithms and ensembles were developed to predict suicide behavior based on childhood trauma, different mental health parameters, and other behavioral factors. The dataset was acquired from 391 individuals from a wellness center in India. Information regarding their childhood trauma, psychological wellness, and other mental health issues was acquired through standardized questionnaires. Results revealed that cascade ensemble learning methods using support vector machine, decision trees, and random forest were able to classify suicidal behavior with an accuracy of 95.04% using data from childhood trauma and mental health questionnaires. The study highlights the potential of using these machine learning ensembles to identify individuals with suicidal tendencies so that targeted interventions could be provided efficiently.
156	Novel Insights into SAR Analysis of Human Head at 5G mmWave Frequencies 	Sunaina Shakya1	Sunaina Shakya1	1 Institute of Engineering and Technology		sunaina13shakya@gmail.com	This paper presents the analysis of electromagnetic radiation exposure and its absorption in human head tissues at frequencies of 24 GHz, 28 GHz, and 30 GHz which are the high-band frequencies used in 5G technology. To guarantee the safety protocol for users, it is important to estimate the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for 5G mmWave networks operating at 24 GHz and above. The SAR level estimation for the 5G mmWave frequencies is done in the following work by designing a microstrip patch antenna operating in the FR2 frequency range, with the use of CST (Computer Simulation Technology). A human head model spherical in shape, composed of skin, skull, and brain is used for determining SAR when put near a microstrip patch antenna representing an exposure source. SAR is determined over both 1 gram and 10 gram of body tissue at three mmWave frequencies. The findings showed that the human head SAR levels fall within the tolerance standards set by the FCC and ICNIRP i.e. below 1.6W/kg for 1g of tissue and 2W/kg for 10g of tissue, ensuring safety towards the mmWave frequencies.

We also describe good practices related to data publishing and how adding metadata can allow for easier data discovery. Availability of such published datasets enables development of even better machine learning models. Publishing of the data is also a requirement for verifiable and repeatable science, leads to greater visibility of the results and enables cooperation and cross domain exchange of ideas.

Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) based semantic segmentation, have emerged as promising approaches for building extraction in remote sensing. Despite their effectiveness in feature extraction, CNN-based methods often suffer from information loss, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various loss functions to enhance building extraction performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of different loss functions on the performance of a semantic segmentation model (UNet) for building extraction. Specifically, we evaluate five commonly used loss functions, including cross-entropy loss (CEL), focal loss, Tversky loss, dice loss and Jaccard loss. Our experiments are conducted on two widely available satellite datasets, namely WHU-I and WHU-II. The results demonstrate that Jaccard loss outperforms the other loss functions for both datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in building extraction tasks.

This research introduces a novel approach to augment conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification by incorporating involution layers, which exhibit inverse characteristics to convolution layers. By integrating these involution layers into the ResNet architecture, a remarkable reduction of nearly 200 times in model parameters is achieved. Despite this substantial parameter reduction, the model's accuracy only experiences a marginal drop of approximately 5% when compared to the original ResNet, both trained on standard datasets. Moreover, a comparative analysis with the lightweight MobileNetV2 model demonstrates the involution-based approach's superior parameter efficiency. This research presents an efficient alternative to traditional CNNs, contributing to advancements in memory utilization and optimization of training costs.

Scalability becomes a crucial concern as the number of IoT devices exponentially increases. Service discovery mechanisms struggle to identify and deliver services in a timely manner due to the sheer volume of devices, resulting in longer response times and delays in real-time service delivery. The expanding service pool leads to a larger search space, further increasing the time required for accurate service discovery. This poses a significant challenge in applications where timely delivery is crucial.

This approach al-lows for trading precision for benefits such as reduced hardware usage, power consumption, and delay periods. In the realm of error-tolerant applications, approximate computing has gained significant attention and requires optimization to meet system needs. The Rounding-based approximate multi-plier employing modified Karatsuba serves as the foundation for an algorithm that achieves approximate multiplication while balancing error and de-sign metrics. However, we have introduced a more efficient approach known as the OR-based approximate multiplier (OR-AM), surpassing the limitations of the rounding-based approximate multiplier. The OR-AM demonstrates superior performance by leveraging the utilization of OR gates. These gates provide several advantages, including reduced power consumption, shorter delay periods, and smaller circuit area. By incorporating OR gates strategically, the OR-AM enhances design metrics while maintaining a satisfactory lev-el of error tolerance. In image processing and other applications reliant on arithmetic operations, multipliers play a vital role. The OR-AM outperforms its predecessors by significantly reducing the number of multipliers required. Furthermore, it optimizes time, space, and power usage by utilizing small multipliers alongside shifting and rounding procedures. In summary, the OR-based approximate multiplier represents a significant advancement in approximate multiplication. By harnessing the power of OR gates, it achieves improved design metrics, surpassing the limitations of the rounding-based approach. The OR-AM's reduced hardware usage, lower power consumption, and enhanced efficiency make it a promising solution for a wide range of applications, including image processing.

The primary objective of malware classification is categorization malware samples into distinct families or classes based on their behavior, characteristics and intent. Traditional signature-based detection methods, though effective against known malware, struggle to identify previously unseen or polymorphic variants. Hence the need for more sophisticated approaches that employ machine learning occurred. In this paper, a benchmarked dataset Big 2015 is used for the malware classification experiment. Seven different machine learning models namely Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost and Bagging are used to train and test the dataset and to establish the one that performs the best. The performance metrices for evaluation are Accuracy, F1-score, Precision and Recall. It is seen that ensemble machine learning approach namely Random Forest, Bagging and Gradient Boost performed better in accordance to the performance parameters considered.
190	Enhancing the Cryptography Security of Message Communication by Modified Secure IDEA Algorithm	Bilas Haldar 1	Bilas Haldar 1	1 The Neotia University		bilasphd2020@gmail.com	The security of data has become a top priority in today's world. An insecure communication network makes data transmission even more challenging. Cryptography can be an effective tool to secure information and ensure the security and confidentiality of information. In cryptography encryption and decryption methods determine communication security, with key sharing. The main purpose of key exchange methods is to provide protection for technology and are not dependent on communication channel security. Encryption and decryption methods determine the transaction security with key sharing. The present work is a new method for generating keys for multi-party communications by using a quasi-group approach. An algorithm for generating a master key from an unordered value gap was proposed in this work using a quasi-group of order n. It is proposed the algorithms to generate and renew multiple subkeys from the primary key and vice versa. Additionally, the proposed methods are based on a Modified Secure IDEA (MS IDEA) algorithm for encryption and decryption using a 256-bit key.  The results showed that these methods improve in time complexity and protection against attacks.

In this work, we proposed a parameterized posit adder for multiple posit formats (N, ES) and a single architecture to perform an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform the different posit operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and Multiply and Accumulate (MAC). To perform any posit arithmetic operation, It is necessary to extract the bit fields to perform the any posit arithmetic operations, so an additional circuitry required to extract the bit fields. To extract the length of the regime bit field, we have proposed the usage of the adder-based leading one detector (LOD) instead of the existing multiplexer-based LOD. The adder-based LOD reduces the design's Area and critical path delay. Further, we have used lower-order size adders to determine the final exponent and regime fields of the sum of the posit adder. To compare the proposed designs with the existing ones, we have considered the product of a number of Lookup tables (LUTs) and propagation delay as $Area\times Delay$ as one of the performance metrics. The synthesis results show that, with the proposed posit adder at (32, 2) posit format, we have reduced $Area x delay$ by 15.69% and 35.71% compared with existing works.

The process was already utilized widely in hospitals, vaccination centres, food processing units and medicine industries, suddenly became crucial in every domain related to our lives. Even though sanitization is considered the first line of defence against pan-demic viruses like COVID-19, it is highly difficult to sanitize every nook and corner of bigger buildings and external structures like Airports, Railway sta-tions, theatres, institutions and hospitals. Slight carelessness to eliminate the virus from the sanitization process can reciprocate in the pandemic spread. Our proposed work deals with utilizing the accuracy and precision of robots to effectively sanitize the bigger structures. The multi-faceted methodology of the work manages the comprehensive investigation of the robotic unit for the social setting. The concentrate additionally stretches out to refine the standard human behavioural reaction for modern robotic consideration in our lives. This will ease up the process and at the same time, will reduce the chance of human error. The robotic structure is powered by a 12V recharge-able battery, which has manual and automation modes of cleaning. During manual mode, we control the robot with an android application installed on the phone and connected with the robot through Bluetooth wireless connec-tivity. During automation, the mode robot moves in different directions and cleans & sanitizes the area on its own. There is an ESP8266-based IoT con-nection unit to update the overall process for the cloud.

Due to the absence of competent ways for detection, they suffer from loss of crop yield every year. This particular subset of ML, deep learning (DL) seemed to have shown much better performance in terms of accuracy. In this pa- per, we use the deep CNN architecture, InceptionNet and transfer learning for the detection and classification of plant diseases. Due to insufficient data availability, we have used DCGAN along with other traditional data augmentation techniques, to increase our dataset. This paper uses a InceptionNet-XGBoost composite model for classification. The said model is also compared against other deep CNN models, and seen to perform better. Moreover, the validity of XGBoost as the most suitable classifier is also shown. The composite model proposed has attained an accuracy of 98.32%. We have also precision, recall and F1 Score as other performance metrics for the comparison of the model.

However, this fatal disease can be treated, and the mortality rate can be decreased if detected at an early stage. The Papanicolaou test is the gold standard for screening cervical cancer patients. However, the process of manual inspection is tedious and subject to manual errors. Thus, computer-based automatic screening is considered a viable alternative. To this end, in the present work, we have developed a novel system for classifying cervical cancer images as either normal or malignant. We have used the Herlev dataset in this study, which is the standard Pap smear image benchmark dataset. The proposed framework uses multiple base deep learning frameworks, namely Vision Transformer, Xception, VGG-19, VGG-16, and ResNet-101, for classification. Further, we have introduced a novel reward-based weighing technique to decide the weights of individual classifiers, which are, in turn, used to make decisions about the final class label of an input image using the weighted average technique. The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC of 96%, 94%, 92%, 93%, and 94%, respectively, for the binary classification task that is normal vs. malignant. An elaborate study of the performance achieved by our proposed framework on the Herlev dataset shows it to be both robust and effective for the Pap smear image classification task.

In recent years, graph-based representations have emerged as a promising approach to capturing inter-region relationships within the visual processing network. However, learning an optimal graph representation from limited data remains challenging, primarily due to the absence of ground truth to guide the learning process. This article analyzes a novel approach to graph-based representation generation using the Adversarial Policy Gradient framework. The adapted framework involves an adversarial game between the Policy Network and the Reward Network, iteratively improving the quality of the generated graph representation. By leveraging the strengths of both networks through this adversarial process, the approach yields refined and informative graph-based representations. Through extensive hyperparameter analysis, the study investigates the impact of various settings, including learning rates, network architectures, and number of episodes, on the performance of the Adversarial Policy Gradient approach. By examining the method's sensitivity to these hyperparameters, the article provides insights into the dynamics of graph-based representation learning and identifies optimal settings for high-quality representation spaces. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential to overcome the challenges associated with learning graph representations from limited data. The findings shed light on the crucial role of hyperparameter selection in the success of the Adversarial Policy Gradient approach, providing researchers with valuable guidance in applying this methodology to various domains and tasks involving representation learning from graph-based data.

Due to the involvement of multiple factors in cyber situations, the adversary is likely to suffer from various cognitive biases. Confirmation bias is one of the many cognitive biases that affect adversarial decisions in cyberspace. However, little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that drive confirmation bias in adversarial decision-making. To test for confirmation bias, one hundred and twenty participants were recruited via a crowdsourcing website and were randomly assigned to one of two between-subjects conditions in a deception-based cybersecurity simulation. Results revealed the presence of confirmation bias in adversarial decisions. Thereafter, a cognitive Instance-based Learning model was built involving recency, frequency, and cognitive noise to understand the reasons behind the reliance on confirmation bias. Results revealed that participants showed reliance on recent events and high cognitive noise in their decisions. We highlight the implications of our findings for cyber decisions in the presence of deception in the real world.

COVID-19 cases were spiking exponentially in densely populated regions, and the health infrastructure was challenged daily. As such, Artificial Intelligence (AI) had to step in to improvise medical imaging applications. One such use case was the classification of Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan images into COVID-infected and un-infected categories. Thus it would effectively classify a patient being either COVID Positive or Negative. Computer Vision (CV) algorithms manifest the potential to solve such image classification problems. In retrospect, deep learning-based architectures have been very productive. However, Vision Transformers (ViT) have taken over CV since its inception. In this study, we propose CoViT-Net: A pre-trained hybrid Vision Transformer architecture for detecting COVID-19 in CT scan images. Our proposed CoViT-Net has a unique architecture incorporating a ViT-S/16 feature extractor, pre-trained on the ImageNet21k dataset, and a modified MLP block with dense layers on top. CoViT-Net has thereby achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy score of 0.9638.

222	Ternary D Flip-Flop in CNFET-Memristor Technology	Shivani Thakur 1, Srinivas Bodapati 2	Shivani Thakur 1, Srinivas Bodapati 2	1 IIT MANDI | 2 IIT Mandi		s21006@students.iitmandi.ac.in, srinivasu@iitmandi.ac.in	This paper presents the design of a ternary D flip-flop to store a ternary digit in Carbon Nanotube FET (CNFET)-Memristor technology. This paper presents three designs of the D flip-flop, one is a latch-based edge-triggered D flip-flop using master-slave configuration, named as LDFF. The other designs use a transmission gate and a buffer to design a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop. A ternary buffer is designed using a standard ternary inverter and ternary cycle operators. A cycle operator-based ternary D flip-flop is named as CDFF, which uses cycle operators in the loop to store a digit. A positive edge-triggered D flip-flop using a standard ternary inverter is named SDFF, which is having less number of CNFETs and memristors. Out of these three designs, SDFF is having better PDP compared to the other designs. In particular, the SDFF takes 40% and 63% of energy compared to the LDFF and CDFF. We have extended the ternary D flip-flop to design a synchronous ternary counter. Extensive simulations were performed, and simulation plots were presented.

In recent times, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention as a potent solution for image restoration, including dehazing. This study proposes a GAN-based dehazing model specifically designed for atmospheric haze removal in images. The model incorporates generator and discriminator components to enhance the dehazing process through adversarial training. To effectively capture spatial and contextual information, various architectures such as MANet, PSPNet and FPN are explored. Additionally, the model incorporates a Vision Transformer as an encoder block to improve feature extraction. The proposed approach is evaluated and trained on the RESIDE dataset and benchmark datasets, utilizing objective metrics like PSNR and SSIM. Furthermore, the model is implemented for real-time dehazing on a Raspberry Pi device. The experimental outcomes and comparative analyses provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving high-quality dehazing results.
226	Privacy Preservation of Insurance Data Sharing Across Permissioned Blockchains	Chappidi Harika 1, Susmita Mandal 2	Chappidi Harika 1, Susmita Mandal 2	1 IDRBT | 2 IDRBT		charika@idrbt.ac.in, msusmita@idrbt.ac.in	With the rise of blockchain as a more promising technology, industries and academia are interested in foreseeing a decentralized and transparent ecosystem of data storing, sharing, and verifying across platforms. The current state-of-the-art blockchain platforms mostly work in isolation with a high level of diversity due to architecture, security, and efficiency. Thus making interoperability difficult. An optimistic approach can be through cross-chain technology that has the ability to transfer data and assets between different blockchains. Recently, security concerns related to cross-chain data exchange have gained a lot of attention. This paper is a work at two folds; first, we analyze and test the issue of oversharing of sensitive data across permissioned platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Second, a smart contract-driven novel approach of authorizing the insurance claimant while preserving sensitive information is designed using NIZKP. This prevents unauthorized data sharing or misuse in the ecosystem. Finally, the results of the solution are presented with security analysis.

World Health Organisation (WHO) describes CVDs as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. Early detection of signs and symptoms of the diseases can lead to effective treatment of the diseases and  in turn prevent premature deaths. Heart sounds, brief and transient, produced due to closing of valves can be effectively made use of to recognise abnormal heart conditions. In this work, various papers have been surveyed and their accuracy rates have been considered. In an attempt to better the accuracy the authors of this paper have considered the dataset collected from Kaggle and developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN model) and LSTM model that classifies the heart sounds into 3 groups (classes) namely, normal, murmur and artifact. The features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) Murmur class of sounds indicate a underlying serious issue. The model considered is able to achieve 96.5\% accuracy for the test dataset. The work can be improved by adding various other layers to the model and can be deployed for use in hospitals wherein timely detection can save human life. 
230	Testing of MEDA-based Biochip: A Proposed Technique for Functional Testing of Symmetric Set of Modules	Pranab Roy 1	Pranab Roy 1	1 J.K. Laxmipat University,Jaipur,Rajasthan		ronmarine14@yahoo.co.in	The MEDA biochip technology allows for the miniaturization of laboratory procedures and the automation of complex tasks of biomedical analysis, making it a valuable tool in many fields, including medicine, biology, and chemistry. One of the advantages of MEDA biochips is their ability to perform multiple analyses simultaneously, which can eventu-ally save time and resources. Due to its higher complexity and parallel execution of mul-tiple bioassays conventional testing methods used for conventional Biochips may not be adequate for fault diagnosis and detection in such devices. In this paper, we proposed new testing techniques for a given symmetric set of modules compatible with higher complexity and applicable for functional testing of MEDA-based biochips. We proposed a functional testing technique involving merging, mixing, and splitting of droplets (both horizontal and diagonal) for a set of modules of a given configuration located symmet-rically within a 2D grid MEDA biochip layout. We simulated the proposed testing tech-nique with the symmetric arrangement of modules with different numbers. Thereby we developed a specific test schedule for different module arrangements resulting in the utilization of optimal test resources, timing, and better module coverage.
231	Speech emotions detection and classification based on speech features using  deep neural network 	Padmashree Desai 1	Padmashree Desai 1	1 KLE Technological University		padmashri@kletech.ac.in	Over the last decade, automatic speech emotion detection has been a major research area in the field of human–computer interaction. However, the current recognition accuracy has to be improved due to a lack of research on the fundamental temporal relationship of the speech waveform. Usually, speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust emotions. Detecting and classifying has become a current research challenge. We developed a model to detect the emotion present in the speech data using Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM). The input audio is preprocessed through various techniques such as normalization, trimming, padding and noise reduction. The audio is then fed into the LSTM model to extract the features and detect the emotions. Feature extraction consists of Energy (Root Mean Square), Zero Crossing Rate and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and Toronto emotional speech set (TESS) combined datasets are used for testing and training the LSTM model. RAVDESS contains 7356 audio files including those of 24 proficient actors (12 male and 12 female). TESS contains 2800 audio files and emotions set on 200 target words spoken by two artists (aged between 26 to 64 years) and consists of eight emotions such as happiness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, pleasant, sadness and neutral. Both datasets combined were used to train and test the LSTM model and eight emotions are detected which produces satisfactory outcomes. We obtained validation set and test set accuracy of 94.23% and 97.47% respectively for our system. The results are equated with the state-of-the-art methods which were found to be better. The proposed work can be improved by experimenting with  other deep learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 
232	Multispectral imaging of Damaged Sacramental Journal pages: A preliminary study	Ankan Bhattacharyya 1, Clifford Seth   Parker  2, William Brent Seales 3	Ankan Bhattacharyya 1, Clifford Seth   Parker  2, William Brent Seales 3	1 University of Kentucky | 2 University of Kentucky | 3 University of Kentuck		ankan.bhattacharyya@uky.edu, c.seth.parker@uky.edu, seales@uky.edu	Multispectral Imaging (MSI) was used to recover the Archimedes Palimpsest. However, the work did not report to have any ink bleedthrough. We develop an MSI pipeline that helps in visualizing the content and the ink bleed-through. As for data, we use damaged pages from the sacramental journal of the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Community (HTGOC) Church, situated in New Orleans. During Hurricane Katrina, this church faced destruction leading to damaged sacramental journals, like ink wash-away, ink bleed-through, torn patches of pages, and mold development. In this work, we try to discover any ink signals that show up in a wide spectrum of light, from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). We also try to study the ink signal response to the different combination of wavelengths and perform an ablation study that gives us a list of combinations of different spectral bands that generates maximum information about the data. The manuscript reports 12 such combinations after the ablation study, and our data use all the wavelengths to produce ink signals, which are in better contrast in comparison to the images captured under visible light.
242	SSANet: Side-by-side Additive Network for Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Detection from X-ray Images	Hiranmoy Roy 1, Debotosh Bhattacharjee 2, Ondrej Krejcar 3, Rakhi   Tewari  4	Hiranmoy Roy 1, Debotosh Bhattacharjee 2, Ondrej Krejcar 3, Rakhi   Tewari  4	1 RCC Institute of Information Technology | 2 JU | 3 University of Hradec Kralove | 4 ju		hiranmoy.roy@rcciit.org.in, debotoshb@hotmail.com, ondrej.krejcar@uhk.cz, rtewari4891@gmail.com	Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is becoming one of the most frequent degenerative and irreversible diseases in elderly people. Its early detection and diagnosis is also a difficult and time-intensive task. The recent advance in Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) created new paths to automatically detect KOA in the early stages. Detecting and grading the severity of KOA requires a dedicated ML model. This paper proposes a Side-by-Side Additive Network (SSANet) based model for detecting and grading the severity of KOA. Since KOA affects the knee joint space by narrowing the gap between the joint, we preprocess the X-ray images to detect the Region of Interest (ROI) before the training of the model. Experimental results show that the ROI selection is really improving the detection accuracy of the model. Unlike sequentially connected convolution layer-based deep learning models, the proposed SSANet is based on a parallel convolution layer to reduce the degradation of feature quality. Again, to enhance the edge feature maps, we apply an additive layer that couples the previous layers' convolutional output. SSANet captures both low-level and high-level features to predict the KOA severity effectively. The presence of a smaller number of layers and fewer numbers of learnable parameters than the existing popular deep learning models, make SSANet a time and space-efficient network. Moreover, the performance of the proposed SSANet in detecting KOA severity is significantly better than that of other popular state-of-the-art networks.

Emotion detection plays an important role in music therapy of human being. But detection of emotion is a problematic task. The objective of this work is to detect the underlying emotion in the audio speech along with a high accuracy. Emotion is a very important factor in communication. It has an impact in making decisions. In the virtual world, where people depend on artificial approaches, analyzing a person’s emotion plays an important role. Thus, objective is to detect the underlying emotion in a the audio speech and assign it to either joy, anger, boredom, sadness, fear, frustration, annoyance, satisfaction or neutral or any other emotion. This work considers neutral, happy, sad and angry emotions only from speech signal. Emotions within speech mostly varies in the frequency domain. MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients) is a very good aural facet for capturing different emotions within speech. MFCC is supported by some other popular frequency domain aural facets as well as some time domain aural facets. ZCR (Zero Crossing Rate) and STE (Short Time Energy) have been used as time domain aural facets, Spectral RollOff, Skewness, Spectral Flux have been used as frequency domain aural facets. For precise observation co-occurrence based facets have also been considered for Spectral Flux as well as MFCC. For classification task Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression have been used. Experimental result exhibits superiority of the work.

In bioinformatics, clustering plays a crucial role that primarily helps to find relations between similar gene sequences. In this work, a new clustering technique has been proposed that uses the concept of tensors, Riemannian manifolds, and geodesics to cluster a given set of biological data. This new method of clustering Next Generation Sequence data has been developed keeping in mind that it should yield previously undetected patterns in such type of data. The proposed work is compared with well-known clustering techniques such as k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms via several metrics (DB index, Dunn index, Rand score, and Silhouette score) and shows its efficiency.  
246	A Hybrid Query Expansion Method for Effective Bengali Information Retrieval	Soma Chatterjee 1, Kamal Sarkar 2	Soma Chatterjee 1, Kamal Sarkar 2	1 Jadavpur University | 2 Jadavpur University		somadey05@gmail.com, jukamal2001@yahoo.com	Automatic query expansion has been extensively studied in information retrieval research as a technique for dealing with the word mismatch problem that occurs when the query words do not match with the words in the documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid query expansion (QE) method which has two phases- (1) candidate expansion term genera-tion phase and (2) expansion term selection phase. In the candidate expansion term genera-tion phase, the statistical, lexical, and semantic methods are combined to automatically generate the candidate expansion terms related to a given query.  In the expansion term selection phase, the candidate terms are ranked based on their contextual and semantic relatedness with the given query. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid query expansion method, we incorporate the proposed method in the Okapi BM25 IR model and then we test the retrieval performance of the enhanced Okapi BM25 IR model on the FIRE dataset which is a benchmark dataset for Bengali information retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid query expansion method. The proposed hybrid query expansion method outperforms the basic Okapi BM25 model by a wide margin.
247	Leveraging POS-tag features for Machine Translation of the Bengali-Nepali Language Pair: A Preliminary Study	Pooja  Rai 1	Pooja  Rai 1	1 Indian Institute of Information technology, Kalyani		poojaphd@iiitkalyani.ac.in	Machine Translation (MT) plays a crucial role in break- ing language barriers and facilitating cross-lingual communication. How- ever, certain language pairs, particularly those with limited linguistic resources, pose significant challenges in building effective MT systems. In this paper, we present the first attempt to build a machine transla- tion system for the Bengali-Nepali language pair, which lacks an existing MT solution. To address the data scarcity issue, we utilized the Bengali- Nepali parallel treebanks, as the training resources for both statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT) ap- proaches. We adopted Moses, a widely-used SMT framework, to develop an initial baseline system. Additionally, we integrated a factored lan- guage model that incorporates Part-of-Speech (POS) features to enhance the SMT-based translation performance. To further explore the potential of NMT for this low-resource language pair, we also experimented with transformer-based architecture. We leveraged the POS information to augment the transformer model and improve its translation capabilities. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of POS features in both SMT and NMT models leads to noticeable enhancements in translation quality. By building upon our initial findings, future research could potentially ad- dress the challenges posed by the scarcity of parallel data and contribute to more effective and reliable MT solutions for this specific language pair.
249	SAYNet: Self-Attention YOLO Network for Human Detection in Thermal and Infrared Images	Soma Hazra1	Soma Hazra1	1 Sister Nivedita University, Kolkata		soma.hazra.frnd@gmail.com	Multi-object detection in a video sequence is a significant challenge for effective surveillance in environments where varying lighting and other environmental factors constrain vision in different places. In this regard, the use of traditional visible cameras (VC) may significantly degrade the performance of multi-object detection as it is sensitive to a variety of environmental factors. In this work, we proposed a self-attention guided deep learning method to effectively detect multiple human-objects (MHO) in Thermal (Tr) and Infrared (Ir) video sequences. In our work, we incorporated Self-Attention Block (SAB) in the You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model, coined as Self-Attention YOLO Network (SAYNet), to detect MHO in Tr and Ir video sequences more effectively. The efficacy of SAYNet has been analysed on four standard Tr and Ir datasets, namely CVC-09, CVC-14, UNIRI-TID, and LLVIP, concerning various performance measures. From the experimental results, it is found that the use of the self-attention in the YOLO model, i.e., SAYNet, performs significantly better than different variants of YOLO model.

We have also shown that Graph Attention Networks can resolve classification discrepancies in WSI based datasets by attenuating outliers and generating intra-class relation aware image-level representations. The problem of scarce training samples and class imbalance has also been resolved by using a blend of Generative Adversarial Networks and digital filters. The proposed framework was evaluated on three benchmark cervical cytology image datasets (SIPaKMeD, Herlev and CRIC) to exhibit the uniformity of performance across all specimen test cases
