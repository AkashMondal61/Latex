        { The convergence of Smart Internet of Things (IoT) and Security is a new study  topic. In this context, a new IoT trend known as Social IoT (SIoT) was examined for this study.  The Social IoT has the advantage of connectivity demonstrated within the network of connected  things via the IoT. In Social IoT, a wide range of IoT devices, such as wearables or monitoring  sensors, are utilized in E-Healthcare applications and the risk of identity theft and impersonation  is a significant concern. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that incorporates multi-factor authentication, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and hash functions scheme to provide  a robust solution for secure and privacy-preserving authentication. Our system provides privacy  protection along with mutual authentication and session key negotiation at a considerably low  computational cost (of up to 71.04\% compared to other existing techniques). }
