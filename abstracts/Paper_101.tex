        {This paper presents the working of a Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) linear image sensor based data acquisition (DAQ) system for monitor-ing of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The working of the image sensor is governed by a driver circuit designed using Proteus 8 Professional and LTspice software respectively. The DAQ system is integrated to a custom made SPR measurement system for continuously monitoring the intensity of the reflected light from a prism in Total Internal Reflection (TIR) condition. The clock and tim-ing signals to the image sensor was provided using a microcontroller which re-ceives the signal voltages from the sensor, performs analog-to-digital conversion for serial transmission to a computer.}
