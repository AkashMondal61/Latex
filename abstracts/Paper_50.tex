        {. Modern world witnesses a widespread usage of video surveillance systems that pro-vide security and protection to properties, resources and infrastructure. This paper presents a theft-detection Convolutional 3D model benefitted from dense optical flow-based feature extraction. It uses the features such as velocities and movement directions from the input and the patterns, in particular temporal and spatial patterns, were learned with the help of autoencoders. The results of the proposed model are demonstrated on multiple video footages, with successful detection of anomalies in most of the video footages effectively in real-time at the false rate of 1.9 and accu-racy of 81\%.}
