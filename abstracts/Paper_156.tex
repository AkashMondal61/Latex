        {This paper presents the analysis of electromagnetic radiation exposure and its absorption in human head tissues at frequencies of 24 GHz, 28 GHz, and 30 GHz which are the high-band frequencies used in 5G technology. To guarantee the safety protocol for users, it is important to estimate the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for 5G mmWave networks operating at 24 GHz and above. The SAR level estimation for the 5G mmWave frequencies is done in the following work by designing a microstrip patch antenna operating in the FR2 frequency range, with the use of CST (Computer Simulation Technology). A human head model spherical in shape, composed of skin, skull, and brain is used for determining SAR when put near a microstrip patch antenna representing an exposure source. SAR is determined over both 1 gram and 10 gram of body tissue at three mmWave frequencies. The findings showed that the human head SAR levels fall within the tolerance standards set by the FCC and ICNIRP i.e. below 1.6W/kg for 1g of tissue and 2W/kg for 10g of tissue, ensuring safety towards the mmWave frequencies.}
