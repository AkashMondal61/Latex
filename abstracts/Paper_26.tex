        {Present article investigates a binary sequence based (BS) method of fault detection for linear antenna array. The method considers generation of possible combination of binary sequence depending on number of elements of the ar-ray. Based on the binary sequence generated corresponding array factor is calculated and compared with the reference array factor which happens to be array factor of faulty linear antenna array. Once the suitable match is anticipated, number of faulty elements along with their respective locations can be obtained. Effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated with 12 elements linear antenna array with both uniform and non-uniform excitation with different faulty elements position. Acceptability of the method has been illustrated through comparative study with previously reported fault detection methods.  }
