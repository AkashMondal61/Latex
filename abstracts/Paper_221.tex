        {Objective: Our objective is to predict age of alcohol initiation (AAI) using De Addiction centres male patient's data. Methods: We collected 2972 male patients' data whose present age is in the range of 18-65 years from a De-addiction centre, in south India. Around 75 features were considered, out of which 35 Relevant features were selected using extra tree classifier feature selection method. Age at alcohol initiation (AAI) was categorized in to 8 age groups and labelled as 1 to 8.  Around 57.9\% patients were in the 18-25 years AAI group and remaining in the other AAI group. This class imbalance was overcome by using Synthetic Minority over Sampling Technique. Predictive models were built using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms and evaluated using accuracy metric. Results: Around 74\% of total patients were in the age range of 25-46 years and maximum alcohol consumption was seen in the age group of 26-32years.The Random forest classifier predicted AAI with a highest accuracy of 94.8\% when compared to other classifiers. }
