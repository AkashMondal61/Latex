        {The generation of straight line segments in hexagonal cell grid is presented in this paper.  The hexagonal grid has two axes where the $u$-axis is aligned with the $x$-axis of coordinate plane and $v$-axis is at $60^{\circ}$ with $x$-axis.  Each cell in the hexagonal grid is known as hexel. The hexagonal cell grid has certain symmetry. Based on the way a digital straight line cuts the hexagonal cell grid,  the straight line consisting of hexels is generated in hexagonal cell grid model. A linear time algorithm which uses geometric transformations to draw a straight line on the hexagonal grid is discussed here.  The digital straight line in square grid is familiar whereas hexagonal grid has certain advantages over square grid. }
