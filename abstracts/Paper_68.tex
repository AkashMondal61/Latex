        {Artifact-free image interpolation is one of the challenging subjects in the super-resolution technique. In many practical applications, linear or cubic interpolation technique is used, but it produces unsatisfactory results in edge and corner regions due to blurring and jagging artifacts. Several methods have been proposed to improve the performance of the interpolation technique, among them somewhere edge guided noniterative technique, curvature-based iterative method, and statistical learning-based method is used. Although it slightly improves the performance of traditional interpolation techniques, it can't avoid blurring artifacts. Moreover, some of the methods are high in computational complexity. In this method, we have proposed a new interpolation technique inspired by the property of gravitational force.  From this property, we have determined whether the region According to the region, 8-neighbors are interpolated with the weighted value of one or more neighbor pixels. Our method is very fast regarding computational complexity and shows its superiority in a well-known interpolation method in respect of subjective and objective quality.  }
