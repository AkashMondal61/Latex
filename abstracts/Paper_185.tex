        {Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-configuring wireless networks where nodes communicate with each other without a fixed infrastructure. Optimizing the performance of MANETs is crucial for achieving efficient and reliable communication. In this paper, we focus on designing the objective function for MANET optimization using metaheuristic algorithms, specifically incorporating both linear and nonlinear terms. The study presents a design strategy that considers the key factors influencing the MANET performance and combines them into a comprehensive objective function. We also discuss the integration of metaheuristic algorithms, such as Cuckoo Search, to effectively optimize the objective function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving optimal solutions for MANET optimization.}
