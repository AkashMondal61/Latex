        {This study raises a novel data security solution that focuses on dynamic authenti-cation of e-documents transmitted in wireless domain. This is mainly achieved by concealing multiple signatures dynamically in circular orientations governed by hash operations performed on shared secret key and session random challenge. Further, with the use of particular bit sequencing patterns dynamically decided through similar hash operations and also region wise segmented casting of such signatures uplifts their security and resilience significantly. Moreover, dynamic threshold reference range based region wise variable encoding of these signatures clearly improves signature protection and recovery under various attacks. Additionally, this work also uses self-defined algebraic block transforms to embed the signature data and thereby enhancing the robustness greatly. Since receiver knows all the secret data, so by adopting exactly same hash functions and reverse mathematical operations of bit coding in proper order those casted signatures can be authenticated trustfully. Finally, exhaustive testing have fully established efficacy of this approach in contrast to the current works from various angles while it also confirms much superior authentication and confidentiality.}
