        {The optimal distribution of solar power in microgrids is crucial for maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing waste. This paper proposes an optimization-based approach for solar power distribution in microgrids, considering both predicted solar energy and actual solar generation. The objective is to optimally distribute solar power among homes in a microgrid while ensuring minimal energy waste. The optimization model is formulated to minimize the squared difference between the distributed power and the demand of each home, subject to constraints on the total distributed power and individual home demands. The distribution technique considers the proportionate share of actual solar generation based on the predicted solar energy distribution. The impact of the accuracy of the solar power forecasting model on energy waste reduction is investigated through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that the energy waste decreases once the accuracy of the forecasting model increases, highlighting the importance of accurate predictions in achieving efficient solar power distribution.}
