        {Know-Your-Customer(KYC) is the process of verifying the identity of the consumers, which is an essential component of organizations (hospitals, financial institutions) handling sensitive data of consumers. To design a reliable automated KYC system with multiple verifiers is difficult, since a single identity theft or data breach may lead to serious frauds. Permissioned blockchain has been evolved as a significant solution to handle sensitive data, which is one of the state-of-art meth- ods for performing KYC. This paper presents a novel smart-contract based system, which utilizes a permissioned blockchain with deep learning enhanced user data acquisition for onboarding consumer. In place of manual data collection, an automated deep learning based data extraction module extracts the data from the uploaded documents which is further utilized by smart contract logic for validation. The proposed framework guarantees that a user, once registered into system, need not repeat the KYC, unless any update is initiated which helps in avoiding repetition of KYC.}
