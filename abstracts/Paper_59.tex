        {In present times, there has been progress in using face detection and recognition for security, identification, and attendance purposes, but still, there are issues. In this paper, we propose an automated face recognition system. The concept of 'INTERNET OF THINGS' is used for face detection which can detect human faces using the Haar cascade classifier. An inbuilt camera is continuously detecting the face frame by frame and the PCA algorithm is used for feature selection. A forward-looking view of face recognition is presented. The experiment results show that the proposed model is very accurate, reliable, and can be practically implemented in a real-life environment as an automatic recognition system.}
