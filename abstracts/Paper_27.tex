        {As a green transportation alternative to lower greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicle adoption (EVA) is receiving a lot of attention on a global level. Unfortunately, the world-wide social acceptance of EVA confronts considerable challenges. The major objective of this paper is to undertake a bibliometric analysis of 1379 research publications from the Scopus database that were published between 2019 - 2023. Utilizing the Biblioshiny R Package, VOS Viewer, and MS Excel applications, intellectual topography and bibliometric analysis of EVA were conducted. The study highlights influential authors, prolific nations, highly cited articles, significant journals, co-occurrence analyses, and research trends. The paper concludes by highlighting areas for additional research and potential future research directions, giving academics a broader knowledge of EVA research.}
