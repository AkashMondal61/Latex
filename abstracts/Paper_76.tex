        {Maintaining the integrity and reliability of user-generated content requires the detection of shilling profiles or attack profiles in recommender systems. By embracing the concepts of Popularity, Quantity User Diversity (QUD), Re-cency User Diversity (RUD), and Mean Popularity of Items (MUP) as essen-tial attributes, we present a unique technique for shilling profile detection in collaborative filtering recommender systems in this study. Our approach at-tempts to improve the precision and dependability of the shilling profile identification algorithms. We run tests on the ML-100K dataset to assess how well our strategy performs using accuracy, Recall, and F1-score measures. The findings show how well our suggested method performs in terms of ac-curacy, Recall, and F1-score values, underscoring how well it can recognize shilling characteristics. This study advances the subject of shilling profile recognition in recommender systems by presenting a thorough strategy that integrates several variables for increased detection precision.}
