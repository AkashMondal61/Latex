        {In this paper, we have bought up a smart approach for web intrusion detection and prevention by making a clever honeypot system in order to fool the hackers and further more to save the confidential information and cyber losses. Our proposed honeypot model works in a three level hierarchical manner. Ä°n the very first level of the honeypot indicates if any attack has been occured in our system. The second level of honeypot highlights the modifications made by the attacker in our sytem. The last level of the honeypot is the most complex system which contains more important features to delay the attacker by influencing him/her to attack on a fake database or directory made by us, which gives us all the detailed information about the attacker and play a major role to protect and recover our credential information.   }
