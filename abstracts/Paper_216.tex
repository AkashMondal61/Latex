        {Multi-label feature selection (FS) is a challenging task due to the varying number of labels and dependencies between labels and features. This paper proposes a filter FS method that uses feature weight (FW) and multi-criteria decision making to address these challenges. The proposed method, FWMABAC-MFS, first uses the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to generate label-specific FWs. These FWs are then used to rank the features and select the most relevant ones using the "multi-attributive border approximation area comparison" (MABAC) algorithm. The proposed FWMABAC-MFS is evaluated on six benchmark datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of different multi-label learning evaluation parameters. Additionally, the efficacy of FWMABAC-MFS is verified using the Bonferroni-dun statistical test. Overall, this paper provides a promising approach to address the challenges of multi-label FS.}
