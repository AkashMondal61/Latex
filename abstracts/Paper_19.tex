        {Igor Ostrovsky's blog, Gallery of Processor Cache Effects, provides a comprehensive demonstration of how processor caches function by presenting various code snippet examples. It delves into the impact of these caches on a program's performance. Many individuals have attempted to reproduce and achieve comparable results to those showcased in the blog. The primary goal of this article is to analyse these replication attempts, identify encountered challenges, and clarify the reasons why replicating similar results using the same examples is difficult. Additionally, this article will also cover topics such as computing the cache line size of the underlying hardware using a simple program, verifying the correctness of the computed value, and generating evidence of the data prefetching technique employed by modern Intel processors.}
