        {Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram provide variety of information regarding the trending news topics in the World today. Currently social media platforms are generating hundreds of petabytes of data on the internet which can be used by the academic researchers and the IT marketing team to extract useful information from it. Sarcasm and Fake News Detection is one such trending area of research that discusses about fake internet articles on the web which has lead to mass confusion amongst the general uninformed public. Existing literatures that are profound in the field of sarcasm and fake news detection mainly focused on two classes i.e. fake or real with machine learning algorithms which can be a limitation when it comes to the news that can be nearly true and classified as fake. Hence the proposed work introduces a real-time framework for sarcasm detection using novel deep learning approach called Tensor-DNN for multiclass.  TDNN Model aims at classifying news article as per its authenticity and also returns the extent of sarcasm within the article. The Algorithm is compared against top state of art techniques such as SVM, att-RNN and EANN among which proposed algorithm provides the best accuracy of 96.4\% for two class, 94.32\% for four class and 99.1\% for seven class accuracies. }
