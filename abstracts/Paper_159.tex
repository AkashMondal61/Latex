        {Arsenic sensing in different water samples including groundwater is of high significance due to its extreme level of toxicity and the ability to penetrate living cells in our body. Various methods have been implemented in this field of work with the help of expensive and sophisticated instrumentation. The construction of a low-cost electrochemical Cobalt Oxide nanoparticle deposited on FTO(Fluorine doped Tin Oxide) electrode is a positive approach towards achieving the goal of arsenic detection from water when pre-sent in small traces in the range of 0.1ppb. The traces of arsenic in water samples are confirmed by observing the voltammograms that are obtained during the cyclic voltammetry process using the prepared Co₃O₄ electrode sensor dipped in the aqueous sample. The peak current and voltage value from the graph determines the amount of arsenic in the water sample. The sensitivity of the proposed device is 0.01mg/L of Arsenic in the water sample.}
