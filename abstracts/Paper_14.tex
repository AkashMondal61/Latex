        {The global prevalence rate of epilepsy is over 50 million, despite modern medical advancements. Early detection of epilepsy can significantly reduce the risk of long-term damage and promote improved living standards. Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to diagnose epilepsy by monitoring electrical activities in the brain. However, EEG data's usage for research and diagnosis purposes creates numerous challenges related to false detections, wrong predictions, patient privacy, and safety measures of such sensitive digital information. Our study proposes a novel solution for secure and private EEG data sharing using blockchain technology, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and machine learning (ML) models that enhance the accuracy and reliability of early diagnosis of epilepsy. }
